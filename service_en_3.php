                    In the process of sale and transfer of a house, there will be a lot of legal risks. Some of the real estate transactions in the United States will be complex and some involve huge amounts of money, so you must ask a lawyer to intervene to protect your property. New York State law requires real estate transactions to be involving, supervising, and directing all legal documents by practicing lawyers. Lawyers are required to participate in everything from checking property rights to signing documents. A property survey conducted by an experienced real estate lawyer can ensure that these issues are resolved early and will not be left to the buyer on the day of the transaction.

                    Only after both parties sign the sales contract can the lawyer's second step start. They went to the Registry of Deeds to investigate property rights. Review the property rights report and review the property certification. If the property is a heritage, you will need to go to the Local Registry of Investigations (Registry of Probate). The title deeds registry and the heritage registrar are governed by counties, and each house is registered there. The transaction history of each house is recorded, and some can be traced to a hundred years ago. Property rights investigations are designed to ensure that house sellers have full property rights and that they can be legally traded. In addition, the property rights survey can also reveal some restrictions on the use of rights. For example, passers-by have the right to pass through the side of the land on that property. As a homeowner, you have no right to stop. This is the right of way. For another example, maybe you have other people's easements. You can use the backyard trail of your left neighbor. These are all stated in the property rights, but they are not known without checking. When you are complacent to buy a house that is cheaper than an equivalent house, you need to understand its property rights and whether there are restrictions on its use. Land that has restrictions on the use of rights will be more troublesome when it is resold in the future.

                      In order to protect their respective interests, both buyers and sellers have their own agents and their own lawyers. Including buyers and sellers, there are a total of six parties. With the help of the two brokers, the buyer and the seller have reached an agreement on the price and additional conditions before the preparation of the sales contract. The lawyers of both parties use legal language and wording for the agreement that has been reached before. Through this sales contract, lawyers of both parties help employers understand the responsibilities and obligations of both parties in the contract they are about to sign, and the legal consequences of the violation.

                      The United States is a society that emphasizes contracts. Written contracts have a crucial role. If you do not perform the obligations specified in the contract, the other party will tell you to court. Therefore, in the process of any transfer or sale of shops, both parties must have lawyers to confirm their obligations to perform. When they find unreasonable conditions or when they do not agree with the original conditions, they should let lawyers and landlords fight for amendments to avoid the Longer and far-reaching influence.

                    There are two legal ways in New York City to evict tenants, recover their arrears or overdue. In the case of recovery of arrears, the room rented to the tenant must be legal and there should be a valid lease between the landlord and the tenant. If you illegally rent a basement or attic apartment to collect rent, you can't use the recovery method to drive out the tenants. For legally rented apartments, when the tenant does not pay, the landlord should hire a professional lawyer to issue an arrears lawyer's recovery letter. If the tenant does not pay within the time limit, the landlord can go to the court to file a recovery arrears suit in order to recover the rent or refuse the tenant. Dodge tenants when not paying.
