                      In New York, accidents are caused by accidents, construction site injuries, medical accidents, and falling injuries.

                      Traffic accidents in New York, injuries to construction sites, medical accidents, and fall injuries are all accidental injuries. Usually, victims receive subsidies from the company. However, when the subsidies are inadequate or unable to obtain subsidies, it is important to have an accidental injury lawyer. If you are hurt, you need to let the lawyer intervene as soon as possible. The sooner the lawyer gets involved, the greater the chance of getting paid. In most cases, lawyer representatives will bring the best results and the highest settlement compensation.

                      In New York, the legitimacy of a contract does not necessarily require that it exist in writing. However, the party who signs or accepts the written contract will be assumed to understand and agree with its content. In general, contractual litigation occurs in two situations and they are not mutually exclusive.
                        • Contract Disputes: One party accused the contract of being established on the basis of fraud and fraud, so it does not constitute legality or there is disagreement between the parties based on the interpretation of the relevant contract.
                        Expert witnesses may sometimes be required to explain the lack of standards in certain industry terms or clauses in industry terms or clarification contracts in various industries.
                        • Contract breach: If one party accuses the other party of ignoring or not fulfilling the requirements in the contract. The contract breach requires you to prove:
                        o The existence of the contract;
                        o The other party breached the contract;
                        o You suffer loss.
                        Knowing the language or terms in the contract is often difficult. When you need to agree or disapprove of the litigation contract, it is best to consult your lawyer.

                      Landlord Tenant Dispute
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                      The New York State Landlord and Tenant Act stipulates rent-related issues, including the regulation of rent and how long a tenant has to pay for overdue rent.
                      </p>
                      <p class="details">
                      The New York State Landlord and Tenant Act stipulates rent-related issues, including the regulation of rent and how long a tenant has to pay for overdue rent. Landlord and tenant laws also set limits on deposits. If the tenants move away, the deposit must be returned within a reasonable time.
                        According to the New York State Landlord and Tenant Act, the landlord must tell the tenant some specific details about the rental house before collecting the deposit. The details of the specific requirements of the landlord to show the rental house are different. You'd better consult your lawyer about the specific requirements of each county. It is the landlord's responsibility to provide "livable" rental housing and the obligation to warn about any potential (not significant) rental housing that may cause damage to the household or the risk of safe use of the home.
                        New York tenants’ homes are required by law to meet their basic structural requirements, as well as health and safety standards, and are in good maintenance. If the landlord neglects maintenance, such as leaking roof or water heater, you have the right to choose:
                        • Detain rent until repair is completed, or
                        • Appropriate “repairs and deducts”, that is, hired maintenance personnel to repair a serious defect, (or buy a replacement part yourself) and deduct the corresponding cost from the rent.
                        However, before you resort to "retained rent" or "repaired and deducted" remedies, you are advised to consult your lawyer about their specific requirements. For example, you must inform the landlord about his important maintenance and give the landlord a reasonable time to repair.
                        The New York State Landlord and Tenant Act stipulates when and how the landlord can terminate the lease. You'd better consult your lawyer about their specific requirements.
                        Here is a simple guide for tenants
                        When can I be expelled from the landlord?
                        If you have a lease contract:
                        1. The lease expires, or
                        2. You owe rent, or
                        3. You have seriously violated your lease terms.
                        If you are a monthly tenant without a lease contract:
                        1. You owe rent, or
                        2. The landlord gave you a notice to move out a month ago.
                        Please pay attention to special rules:
                        1. If you live in a public house (HUD or 8th home), they have their own special rules.
                        2. Landlord's retaliation strikes: New York State law prohibits landlords from taking revenge against tenants. Retaliation includes breach of contract or instituting an expulsion lawsuit; raising rent; or reducing services such as locking the laundry. If the landlord has the above behavior within six months of the tenant has exercised legal rights (such as complaining that the landlord is unsafe for the apartment), the New York State Act will presume it as retaliation.
                        3. The United States Constitution prohibits landlords from refusing to rent or require different rents or provide different services based on race, color, religion, nationality, gender, disability facilities, and family status (children under the age of 18).
