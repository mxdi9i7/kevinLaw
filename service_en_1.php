              <h1>Investment Immigration (EB-5) Visa</h1>
              <p>The EB-5 project, also known as the "U.S. investment immigration" project, was set up in 1990.</p>
              <p class="details">
              The EB-5 Visa, also known as the “American Investment Immigration” visa, was enacted in 1990 and is one of the many channels to immigrate to the United States. With only 10,000 visas granted each year, this visa has the least amount of qualification restrictions as well as the shortest waiting period for approval.  
              <br>
              According to this plan, foreign immigrant applicants who invest in the United States to create a commercial enterprise that benefits the U.S. economy and create 10 full-time U.S. workers’ employment opportunities are eligible for a two-year conditional immigrant visa. If the investment behavior visa applicant still exists, the applicant can apply for the condition to be removed and become permanent residents. Such application must be done 90 days before the two-year expiration date of the conditional immigration visa.
